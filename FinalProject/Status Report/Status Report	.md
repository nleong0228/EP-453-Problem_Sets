## Purpose

To update the status of my final project

## Accomplished
So far I have implemented a line drawing mechanism in SpriteKit, along with a circle that follows the path of the drawn line. I have also been able to print out the coordinates of each circle drawn.

## To Implement
The program still lacks the ability to send out multiple MIDI CCs, and does not have multi touch capability

## Issues
I struggled with finding a way to report coordinates of each circle, but was able to fix it by creating an array of circles and calling their index position.
