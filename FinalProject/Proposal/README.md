# Final Project Proposal

### Project Title

Sonic Painter

### About

MIDIPainter will be a drawing app that allows the user to control MIDI CCs through drawing. The program will incorporate colors that will correlate with different MIDI CC numbers. There will be two different navigation views. One for MIDI CCs and one for note messages.

I will most likely be viewing the MultiTouchSynth example from a few weeks back to implement this program since it is fairly similar in concept. In addition to this I will be viewing AudioKit and SwiftUI documentation to execute this program.

### Good Outcome

A good outcome for this project would be the implementation of at least one MIDI CC controller via the drawing app.

### Better Outcome

A better outcome would be having multiple drawn lines sending multiple MIDI CCs through the drawing app

### Best Outcome

The best outcome of this project would be an inclusion of both the MIDI CC controller and the MIDI note quantizer view. In addition a menu where the user can choose scales or motifs for the sequencer to follow.

### Next Steps

The next steps for this project would be a deep dive in to drawing apps using Swift. Furthermore, creating a sequencer and finding example projects that I can follow would be needed. I most likely will start by revisiting the MultiTouchSynth app for references and starting points.
