# Final Project Proposal

### Project Title

Sonic Painter

### About

Sonic Painter will be a drawing app that allows the user to control a synth sequencer and LFO through drawing. The program will incorporate a number of brushes and colors that will correlate with different sounds or scales/motifs. There will be two different navigation views. One for the sequencer and one for the LFO, the LFO side will be modulating sounds that have been sequenced matching the colors to the modulation source. 

I will most likely be viewing the MultiTouchSynth example from a few weeks back to implement this program since it is fairly similar in concept. In addition to this I will be viewing AudioKit and SwiftUI documentation to execute this program.

### Good Outcome

A good outcome for this project would be the implementation of at least one sound as a sequencer in the drawing app. 

### Better Outcome

A better outcome would be having multiple sounds correlating with different colored brushes in the sequencer. 

### Best Outcome

The best outcome of this project would be an inclusion of multiple colors and multiple synth sounds in the sequencer. In addition a menu where the user can choose scales or motifs for the sequencer to follow. Also, the second navigation view where the user can implement an LFO to the sequencer would be ideal.

### Next Steps

The next steps for this project would be a deep dive in to drawing apps using Swift. Furthermore, creating a sequencer and finding example projects that I can follow would be needed. I most likely will start by revisiting the MultiTouchSynth app for references and starting points.
