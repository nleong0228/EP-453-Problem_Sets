* 01.MultiTouchSynth
* MultiTouchChorus

## Purpose
To explore the use of multi touch and UIKit

## Description

ProblemSet 8.1 asked to modify the MultiTouchSynth materials, to and add an XYPad accessible through a navigation view. This XYPad is meant to be a modification of the one from previous problemset but with capability for up to 10 touches. These touches control the oscillator, lowpassfilter, and reverb nodes.

The problemset also asked to create a new instrument from the materials. I created a similar multitouch synth, but instead the coordinates control chorus and detuning of the oscillator.

## Dependencies
This project requries the use of AudioKit and SwiftUI
