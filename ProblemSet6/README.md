## Purpose
To explore using different tabs in Swift, along with introducing classes

## Description 

ProblemSet6.1 asked to create a class that takes different categories of weather, including high and low temps and precipitation. It then asked to create two instances of this class and subtract them from each other. Then printing the result

ProblemSet6.2 went through adding on a tab to the existing tabplayer project, that uses the AppleSampler sampler from audiokit. The problemset asked to nota only add a new tab that loops two new samples, but also add buttons to stop the samples and a slider for amplitude.

## Dependencies
This project requires the use of AudioKit, SwiftUI, Sliders, and AVFoundation
