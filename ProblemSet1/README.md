## Purpose
To understand how to use Github version control, write readme files with markdown, and create a swift program using Xcode

## Description

Problem Set 1.1 covered using Github for git version control systems. This covered basic functions of the git version control system like comitting, pulling, and pushing. Problem Set 1.2 covered using markdown to write a read me file. By using different syntax we are able to format a readme file that shows in GitHub nicely formatted. Problem Set 1.3 involved creating a program in swift and printing out "hello swift". It also involved exploring the simulators and different functions within xcode to change formatting.
