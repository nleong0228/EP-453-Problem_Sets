## Purpose
To explore recording audio and managing files within swift

## Description
ProblemSet 9.1 first asked to add a timer text above the record button. This text acts as a stopwatch, keeping track of the length of the recording

The problmeset then asked to fix a bug where recording continues when switching to a different view. Here we incorporated a way to stop the recording when we enter the library view.

Lastly, the problemset asked for the addition of a delete all button within the libraryview.

## Dependencies

This project requires the use of SwiftUI, AVFoundation, AudioKit
